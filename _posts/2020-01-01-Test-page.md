- [Game Engine](#game-engine---kaffe3d)

### Game Engine - Kaffe3D
Game Engine that allows player to walk around 3D scenes that are built within edit mode. Written in C++. Libraries used: OpenGL for rendering, Assimp for 3D model importing, and OpenAL for audio. Players movement is based off a simple physics system with sliding collisions.

Full Engine source code available on [Github](https://github.com/ZackDG/Kaffe3D)
